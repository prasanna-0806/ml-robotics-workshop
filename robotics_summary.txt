Key Components of a Robot-

1. Structure: This is the robot's physical body, that is designed to copy or be like the movement and flexibility of human limbs. It is built using links and joints that enable motion jsut like our arms and legs.

2. Sensors: Robots should be able to sense their surroundings to function. External sensors, like cameras and etc will help them see and feel the environment. Now coming to internal sensors, like encoders will track their own movements to keep themselves correct.

3. Actuators: These are the important parts that will bring the robot to life. Actuator like motors wkll move the robot’s joints turning instructions into real motion like how our muscles work again mimicking humans.

4. Control System: This main component is as the robot’s brain. It processes data from the sensors and decides what needs to be donr then it sends signals to actuators to perform the action.

5. Power: Every robot needs energy to start itself usually through batteries or electric stuff.

All these components work together to help robots do tasks, understand their surroundings and act accordingly.



Applications of Robotics in the Real World-

1. Manufacturing: Factories rely on robots to perform tasks like assembling products, complete works, and handling materials, etc. They work faster and more accurately than humans by reducing mistakes and keeping people safe from dangerous jobsalso from doing repetitive jobs again and again. Industries like car manufacturing and all are already using these robotic systems.

2. Medical Field: Robots are making healthcare smarter and more precise. In surgeries, robots assist doctors by performing delicate operations with incredible accuracy, which reduces recovery time for patients. Beyond surgery, robots help with physical therapy, assist those with mobility issues, and even perform hospital tasks like delivering supplies.

3. Hazardous Environments: Robots go where humans can’t. Like when radioactive jobs, it is dangerous for humans to work there, then robots can be replaced to decrease death. In space, robots can explore distant planets and gather data. In underwater they discover new species, discover lost things. 

This is how robots can be applied in real life, they are very helpful to us until they won't take a turn on us.
