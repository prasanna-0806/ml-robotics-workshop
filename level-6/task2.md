## Instructions

1. Load the `datasets/grid_environment.json` dataset.
2. Implement the training loop for the agent in the grid.
3. Visualize the agent's path from the start to the goal.
4. Calculate the cumulative reward for the trained agent.

## Submission

1. Upload your Python code, path visualization, and reward calculation to your repository.
2. Submit the link in the `#level-6-submissions` channel.
