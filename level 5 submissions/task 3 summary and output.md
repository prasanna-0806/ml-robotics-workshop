### Summary of Findings

#### Task 1: Regression Model 
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Indicates the average error in predicting future_movement. A lower value suggests better performance.
- R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model explains the variance in future_movement. Higher values (closer to 1) indicate a better fit.
- Findings:
  - The regression model showed reasonable predictive performance, with an RMSE of [value] and R² of [value].
  - The scatter plot of actual vs predicted values shows alignment but may highlight areas where the model struggles with precision.

#### Task 2: Classification Model 
- Accuracy: Indicates the percentage of correct predictions.
- Precision: Evaluates how many of the predicted categories were correct (weighted average across all classes).
- Recall: Measures the model's ability to identify actual instances of each class.
- Confusion Matrix: Visualized the classification performance for normal, warning, and critical labels.
- Findings:
  - The classification model achieved an accuracy of [value], with precision and recall both around [value].
  - The confusion matrix highlighted strong classification of normal and critical, with some misclassifications in the warning category
