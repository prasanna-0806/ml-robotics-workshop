1. Supervised learning: The idea of supervised learning is that the learning system is given inputs and told which specific outputs should be associated with them. We divide up supervised learning based on whether the outputs are drawn from a small finite set (classification) or a large finite or continuous set (regression).

Example- 
• Image classification: Identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
• Sentiment analysis: Identifying whether a review is positive, negative or nothing. 

2. Supervised learning- 
• The idea of supervised learning is that the learning system is given inputs and told which specific outputs should be associated with them. We divide up supervised learning based on whether the outputs are drawn from a small finite set (classification) or a large finite or continuous set (regression). 
• It needs labeled data.
• It can predict a target.
• It can predict labels or continoues values.

Unsupervised learning-
• Unsupervised learning doesn't involve learning a function from inputs to outputs based on a set of input-output pairs. Instead, one is given a data set and generally expected to find some patterns or structure inherent in it.
• It works on unlabeled data.
• It can find hidden patterns, groups, etc.
•  Can on clusters, etc.


3. Reinforcement learning- 
• In reinforcement learning, the goal is to learn a mapping from input values x to output values y, but without a direct supervision signal to specify which output values y are best for a particular input.
• Requires no labeled data.
• Feedback is in the form of a reward based on actions.
• It tries to explore and exploit more.

Supervised learning-
• The idea of supervised learning is that the learning system is given inputs and told which specific outputs should be associated with them.
• Requires labeled data.
• Feedback is in the form of correct output.
• It does direct learning from the input data.
