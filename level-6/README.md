# Level 6: Reinforcement Learning Basics

## Overview

In this level, you will learn the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and how it can be applied to robotics. RL enables robots to learn optimal actions by interacting with their environment and maximizing cumulative rewards.

### Objectives

1. Understand RL concepts: agents, environments, rewards, and policies.
2. Implement Q-learning for simple decision-making tasks.
3. Optimize a robot's navigation policy in a simulated grid environment.

### Tasks

1. **Task 1**: Implement a simple Q-learning agent.
2. **Task 2**: Train the agent to navigate a 5x5 grid environment while avoiding obstacles.
3. **Task 3**: Optimize the robot's policy for maximum cumulative rewards.

### Resources

- `datasets/grid_environment.json`: Defines the grid environment and reward structure.
