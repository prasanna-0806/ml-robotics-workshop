explanation-
Code makes a bar chart to show the height and weight of five people. Each person is given an ID from 1 to 5, and for each one, there are two bars: one for their height and one for their weight. The height bars are blue, and the weight bars are green. These bars are placed next to each other, with a little space between them, so you can easily compare the two. The chart has labels on the bottom for the person’s ID, and the side shows the measurements for height and weight. There’s also a title at the top of the chart that tells you it’s comparing height and weight, and a legend to explain which color stands for height and which for weight. This chart helps you quickly see how each person’s height and weight stack up against each other.
